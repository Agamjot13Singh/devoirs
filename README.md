It's a personal project that will help my class mates copy the homework and classwork that they were missing or didn't understood.

## Getting Started

Just install the file

First make sure you have flutter sdk installed on your machine, if you don't you can download it from here
- Official flutter download page https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install
If you already have flutter in your machine just dowload the file or clone it. Installed? Open pubspec.yaml in the root directory of the project(folder) then hit ctrl+s on windows and cmd + s on mac and it will be ready to go! What it will do is that it will resolve all the errors you were facing.

Done these steps? Enjoy!
